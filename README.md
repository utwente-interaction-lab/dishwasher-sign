# 3D Printed Dishwasher Sign
This repository contains the CAD source files and exported STL files for our 3D printed dishwasher sign. The sign is a nice visual reminder to indicate whether the dishwasher is in use or can be loaded with dirty dishes. It attaches to the door, and will keep it slightly open when not in use to prevent mould and bad smells.

Print with PLA, 0.4mm nozzle, 0.2mm layer height. Increase outer perimiters to around 10 for extra strength. If necessary you can tweak the tolerances in the included CAD file.

Please feel free to modify or reuse.
