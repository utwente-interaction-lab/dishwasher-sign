# 3D printed dishwasher sign
This repository contains the source files for our 3D printed dishwasher sign. The sign is a nice visual reminder to indicate whether the dishwasher is in use or can be loaded with dirty dishes. It attaches to the door, and will keep it slightly open when not in use to prevent mould and bad smells.

Please feel free to modify or reuse.
